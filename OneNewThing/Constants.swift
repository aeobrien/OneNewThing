// Constants.swift

import Foundation
import SwiftUI // For Color and its extension

/// Basic constants, can be expanded as needed.
struct Constants {
    // Example: Maybe a default animation duration
    // static let defaultAnimationDuration: TimeInterval = 0.3
    
    // Add other app-wide constants here.
}

// Color extension toSIMD4 moved to Extensions.swift to keep this file minimal
// or can be kept here if preferred for organization.
// If it's in both, ensure there's no conflict or choose one place.
// For this setup, assuming it's primarily in Extensions.swift for broader utility.

// You can add other global constants or static configurations here.
// For example, API keys if not managed by a dedicated service (though not recommended for sensitive keys).
// struct APIKeys {
//     static let openAI = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" // Placeholder - manage securely!
// }

// Default Journaling Parameters (if any specific to OneNewThing)
// struct JournalDefaults {
//    static let defaultRecordingTypeName = "VoiceJournal"
// }
